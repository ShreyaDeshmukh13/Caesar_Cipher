# Caesar_Cipher
The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that shifts letters in a message a fixed number of positions down the alphabet: 
**How it works**
Each letter in the plaintext is replaced with a different letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the shift is three, D is replaced by A, E becomes B, and so on. 
**Who used it**
Julius Caesar is said to have used the Caesar cipher in his private correspondence. Many other military leaders also used it to protect their communications. 
**How to decrypt**
To decrypt the ciphertext, apply the same number of shifts in the opposite direction.
